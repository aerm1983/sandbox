Install python embeddable:
= = = = = = = = = = = = = =
(1) Download zip containing embeded python, extract files in appropiate folder
(2) Test installation in folder, run ".\python -V" to check version
(3) Download "get-pip.py" through "pypi" site, "pip" package, install instructions
(4) Run ".\python .\get-pip.py", this will add "Scripts" and "Lib" folders
(5) In "python[V]._pth" file, add line ".\Lib\site-packages"
(6) Test installation, run "python -m pip -V", run ".\Scripts\pip -V" to check version
(7) Add python root folder and "Scripts" folder to environment variable "PATH"
(8) Rename "python[V]._pth" file to "python[V]._pth.deprecated" (this file prevents correct functioning of "sys.path" in scripts)
(9) Test a script using "import sys" and "print(str(sys.path))" to check module search paths
(10) Environment variable %PYTHONPATH% is also an option for module importing
