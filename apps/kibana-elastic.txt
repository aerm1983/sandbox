Notes:

(1) Searches by complete word.

(2) If search is not enclosed in double quotes, word order does not matter.

(3) Star character (*) is wildcard for 0 or more letters in word.

(4) Several characters are sord separators, here between double quotes: " .,</". Also others.

(5) Search seems to be not case sensitive.

(6) Timestamp field is local time.  Timestamp within log field is text, at server-location time.

Example:

kubernetes.container_name : merchantlogisf and log : "2023-02-15T10:50" and log : "received response" and log : Login*Dep2
